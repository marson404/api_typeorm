# Awesome Project Build with TypeORM

Steps to run this project BY: Jomari C. Marson:

1. Run npm install express typeorm mysql2 joi bcryptjs reflect-metadata in your terminal
2. Run npm install -D @types/express @types/node @types/joi @types/bcryptjs in your terminal
3. Run npm install -g ts-node in your terminal
4. Open Xampp or any of your application to run your database. (For me it was Xampp(Me and my Friends found a way to make Xampp wokr for typescript))
5. Lastly run ts-node src/server.ts (This should pop up Server started at http://localhost:7000 and Database connected)
6. If it doesn't work ask CHATGPT :P TEHEE
